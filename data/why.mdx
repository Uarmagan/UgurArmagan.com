What is this? Ugur's writing a blog now? That's right folks, I'm starting a blog! Just the thought of another human being reading my writing is nerve-wracking to even think about, but here we are. I'll get to why this is a thing, but I think it's worth it to jump into some quick background to understand how I got here and where I'm going.

### Self Doubt and Perfectionism

Self-doubt and perfectionism have been regular themes in my life. I often doubt myself and have bad imposter syndrome, but for the last year, it's been crippling. Every time I try to break out of it, it pulls me back in. I knew I needed to do something that would **scare the shit out of me**.

## Let's Build a Blog

> Mind is conditioned to think about self. Even when it thinks about “others.”

> The Mind that is prevented from thinking about self,

> Goes silent

I woke up early on a weekend, brewed some coffee, and got to work. After about five minutes of work, the questions came. What would I even write about? Should I code it in React, Vue, Svelte? Which static site generator should I use? The questions go on and on. After I took tons of time to plan things out and remove any uncertainty, I actually start. However, after going halfway through the self-doubt creeps in.

- "I shouldn't have written this with Gatsby"
- "I should have used NextJS"
- "I don't know what to write about"
- "I'm not a writer"
- "People are going to laugh"

## Pushing through

I coded and re-coded the blog three times. Three separate times, where I designed, took the time to learn how to code with a different framework, got halfway through, only realizing that it's not what I wanted and giving up. With all the other things going on in my life (I'll save that for another blog post), I was at a low point.

We went into the new year and 2021 was going to be different. I told myself, I don't care anymore. Nothing matters, but getting it done. No more mind games, no more caring about what other people think.

I started on the blog with a very simple design and told myself that giving up is no longer an option..**I finished the blog in two days**..After starting and stopping for months, it only took two days!!! It was all in my head all along. I had the tools. I had the knowledge. I was just scared. Granted, this blog isn't very complex, but it's a start.

## From Here On out

First I want to thank you for reading this all the way through. You must be a pretty special person in my life or maybe you just have nothing better to do 😄. With that said, this blog is not really a blog and it's okay if people don't read it. I'm not trying to build a brand, get famous, or get rich from this blog. This blog is my home and it's where my thoughts live. I might write about coding tutorials one day, goals vs processes the next, and the perfect chicken tortilla soup recipe.

I want to iteratively continue building on this blog and truly make it my home on the internet. Whatever it becomes, I know that it's going to be unapologetically me.
